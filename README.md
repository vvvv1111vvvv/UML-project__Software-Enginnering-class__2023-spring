Designed Movie Recommand System with UML



## 📝 Description 

Based on what I learned in the software engineering course, I perform 

software system design using UML tools. The system is set as a 'movie 

recommendation system.' After specifying the requirements, defining entities, 

creating a use case diagram, and setting up a domain model, I have written 

a class diagram. Based on this, I have created a sequence diagram and additionally 

selected two classes to create a state diagram. Finally, I have enhanced visibility 

by creating an Activity diagram at both the system and method levels. This system is 

inspired by online movie streaming websites like Netflix. Users of the system can browse 

information about movies, check details about actors and directors, and receive movie 

recommendations from administrators based on their ratings. Administrators can manage the 

database, allowing them to add, modify, or remove new movies, directors, and actors.
