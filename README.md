Designed Movie Recommand System with UML



## 📝 Description 

I perform software system design using UML tools : 'movie recommendation system' 

After specifying the requirements, defined entities, created a use case diagram,

and set up a domain model, I documented class diagrams. Also, I designed a sequence diagram

and state diagram, and Activity diagram at both the system and method levels. 


This system was inspired by Netflix. Users of the system can browse information about 

movies, check details about actors and directors, and receive movie recommendations 

from administrators based on their ratings. Administrators can manage the 

databases, allowing them to add, modify, or remove new movies, directors, and actors.
